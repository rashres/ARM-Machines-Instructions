# ARM-Machines-Instructions

UI Development:

Create a graphical user interface using Java that features input fields for users to enter ARM mnemonic instructions.
Include buttons for encoding the input ARM instruction into binary and hexadecimal numbers.
Display JTextFields to show the results of encoding in both binary and hexadecimal formats.

Encoding and Decoding:

Implement encoding functionality to convert ARM mnemonic instructions into binary and hexadecimal numbers.
Provide decoding functionality to translate binary and hexadecimal numbers back into ARM mnemonic instructions.
Handle different valid inputs gracefully, allowing for both uppercase and lowercase variations of instructions.

User Interaction:

Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to ARM instruction formats, providing clear error messages for invalid entries.
Display the encoded binary and hexadecimal results in separate JTextFields for easy user access.
Offer a seamless experience by allowing users to switch between encoding and decoding operations with intuitive buttons and feedback.
